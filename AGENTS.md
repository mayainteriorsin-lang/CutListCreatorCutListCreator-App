# Agent Instructions

- Protected logic: wood grain rotation rules.
- Do not modify these files or their behavior without explicit user request:
  - client/src/features/standard/dimensional-mapping.ts
  - client/src/features/standard/optimizer.ts
- If a change is required, ask first and keep the rotation lock for wood-grain panels.
